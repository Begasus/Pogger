* Add subscriptions
	* Feed files in ~/config/settings/Pogger/subscriptions/
		* Default column layout, somehow?
	* Use these Feed files as the cache files
		* ~/config/cache/Pogger should be used only by random URL argvs
	* Adding/editing from GUI
		* Do this for file refs when Feeds, too
* Revamp configuration
	* Fix saving, etc.
* Notifications
	* On new entries
		* Sound effect, too
	* On failures
* Show progress
	* With progress bar
	* With indicator in the feeds list
* Timed updating
* Remove unnecessary `new`-- make sure to delete everything
* Check if arg is a file or not (treat appropriately)
* No hardcoded paths
* Show in desktray
	* Make archivable
	* Get menu working
* Add proper scripting support
* Multiple downloads at once?
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
		* In which case, it'd probably make sense to only spin them
		  up as necessary, and kill when everything's done.
			* That'd require a proper queue system, instead of just
			  sending data to the download thread lol
