Important Features:
* Show download progress/failures in FeedView's feedlist
* Update FeedView's feedlist when feeds added/removed
* Show in desktray
	* Make archivable
	* Get menu working
* Default column layouts for ~/feeds and ~/config/settings/Pogger/Subscriptions
* Localization


Important improvements:
* Proper queue list (see Multiple downloads at once?)
* No hardcoded paths
* Remove unnecessary `new`-- make sure to delete everything
* General input sanitization
* File error-handling
	* e.g., Utils.cpp's userFileError
* Check if arg is a file or not (treat appropriately)
* Make UI friendly to whatever font-size you throw at it
	* Give a max size to the progress label in FeedsView
* Make fancy Markdown README


Nice Improvements:
* Proper scripting support
* Store feeds in kEnqueueFeeds/etc messages as paths? hmm
	* This way, if the user edits the feed after it is enqueued but before
	processing, the changes will be applied.
* Multiple downloads at once?
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
		* In which case, it'd probably make sense to only spin them
		  up as necessary, and kill when everything's done.
			* That'd require a proper queue system, instead of just
			  spamming data to the download thread lol
				* Using a proper queue list would give faster 
				  results to Notifer about how many feeds are
				  enqueued (so things *feel* faster)
