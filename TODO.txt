Important Features:
* Default column layouts for ~/feeds and ~/config/settings/Pogger/Subscriptions
* Localization


Important improvements:
* Stop memory accumulation
	* A few MB accumulate on every update
	* ime it's than .1 MB per feed― but if you have several feeds, it can
	  accumulate to a hefty sum after some time. In my case, with ~40 feeds
	  and updates every 30 minutes, it got to about 200MB after a week or
	  so.
	* _Huge_ problem, but I haven't had luck figuring it out yet…
* Move from BLists to BObjectLists where possible
* Fix background of Feeds List error status icon (it's black, not transparent)
* Make UI friendly to whatever font-size you throw at it
	* Give a max size to the progress label in FeedsView
* Make fancy Markdown README
* Make an icon, somehow (idk I'm not an artist)


Nice Improvements:
* Proper scripting support
* Show in desktray
* Store feeds in kEnqueueFeeds/etc messages as paths? hmm
	* This way, if the user edits the feed after it is enqueued but before
	processing, the changes will be applied.
* Move the provisional BList download queue to a BJob + JobQueue system
	* This might add some more flexibility
* Multiple downloads at once
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
