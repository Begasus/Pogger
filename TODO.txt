* Feeds list
	* Update when feeds are edited
* Store feeds in kEnqueueFeeds/etc messages as paths? hmm
	* This way, if the user edits the feed after it is enqueued, the changes
	  will be applied.
* Support for clearing queue
* Revamp configuration
	* Fix saving, etc.
* Show progress
	* With progress bar
	* With indicator in the feeds list
* Configurations
* Remove unnecessary `new`-- make sure to delete everything
* Check if arg is a file or not (treat appropriately)
* No hardcoded paths
* Default column layouts for ~/feeds and ~/config/settings/Pogger/Subscriptions
* Show in desktray
	* Make archivable
	* Get menu working
* Proper scripting support
* Multiple downloads at once?
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
		* In which case, it'd probably make sense to only spin them
		  up as necessary, and kill when everything's done.
			* That'd require a proper queue system, instead of just
			  spamming data to the download thread lol
