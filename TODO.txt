Important Features:
* Default column layouts for ~/feeds and ~/config/settings/Pogger/Subscriptions
* Localization


Important improvements:
* Memory leaks
	* ~50kb per feed on download (+2MB w 40 feeds)
		* This leak is in Util.ccp, fetch(). I'm stumped here.
	* ~20kb per feed on parsing (+1MB w 40 feeds)
* Fix background of Feeds List error status icon (it's black, not transparent)
* Make UI friendly to whatever font-size you throw at it
	* Give a max size to the progress label in FeedsView
* Make fancy Markdown README
* Make an icon, somehow (idk I'm not an artist)


Nice Improvements:
* Proper scripting support
* Show in desktray
* Move the provisional BList download queue to a BJob + JobQueue system
	* This might add some more flexibility
* Multiple downloads at once
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
