Important Features:
* Localization


Important improvements:
* Memory leaks
	* ~.05MB per feed on download, in Util.ccp, fetch(). I'm stumped here.
	* ~.02MB per feed on parsing
* Fix background of Feeds List error status icon (it's black, not transparent)
* Make an icon(idk I'm not an artist)


Nice Improvements:
* Proper scripting support
* Show in desktray
* Move the provisional BList download queue to a BJob + JobQueue system
	* This might add some more flexibility
* Multiple downloads at once
	* Array of thread_ids for multiple DL threads?
