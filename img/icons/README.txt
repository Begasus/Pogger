The mimetype icons (FeedIcon and EntryIcon) and status icons (DownloadStatus,
ErrorStatus) are all copied over from Haiku's source tree at:
	haiku/data/artwork/icons/File_RSS_Feed
	haiku/data/artwork/icons/Server_NewsFeed
	haiku/data/artwork/icons/Action_GoDown_3
	haiku/data/artwork/icons/Action_Stop_1

The program icon (PoggerIcon) is basically a mashed together File_RSS_Feed and
Server_NewsFeed. It's not particularly good. :P

They're under the MIT license, as per haiku/data/artwork/ReadMe
