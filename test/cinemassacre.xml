It shows a guy in an ape costume touching a glowing egg, then getting shot in the air like a rocket! What with that? Well, that movie is called GRUNT from 1983, and it's some weird Italian caveman movie. Let's dive into the history of how I figured it out. Enjoy this Cinemassacre review!

Joe: The Movie from 1987, which capped off the first two seasons of the TV run. In the movie, G.I. Joe's Special Task Force finds its mission to preserve peace and freedom threatened by the evil Golobulus. Created at the height of the G.I. Joe craze in the 1980s, G.I. Joe: The Movie was intended as a theatrical release to be closely followed by The Transformers: The Movie. However, the G.I. Joe film encountered unexpected production delays which allowed the Transformers feature to be released first. Due to the poor box office performances of The Transformers: The Movie and My Little Pony: The Movie, G.I. Joe: The Movie was instead released direct-to-video as well as aired on television in syndication, first in feature-length format and later split into a five-part miniseries format as part of the series' syndication package.

You Know What’s BS!? Apple’s Lack of Buttons! (YKWBS Episode 38.) The BS is back, unlike Apple bringing back their buttons. They went from keyboards with the Macintosh to a phone with one giant button, to no buttons with the iphone. It's getting ridiculous Apple!

When she grows up and has an emotional crisis, he returns to &quot;cheer her up&quot; in his own unique way, causing more chaos than ever before.

Cinemassacre reviews Night Killer (Italian: Non aprite quella porta 3). It's a 1990 Italian horror film directed by Claudio Fragasso. On its release in Italy, it was promoted as being part of the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film is not part of the series and bears little content from the previously released films. In the movie, a serial killer with a rubber-like Freddy Krueger mask terrifies the city of Virginia Beach.

James, Justin, and Kieran traveled to the last Blockbuster Video that's located in Bend, Oregon!! They took a road trip down from Portland, after Portland Retro Gaming Expo weekend October, 2019. The sights, sounds, and smells of their old stomping grounds was like something else. A flash from the past, where you would always go every Friday night to get the newest movie releases, hottest games, or obscure b-movie rentals. Sadly, Blockbuster's 9,000 world-wide locations dwindled down to just one. But, that comes with everything turning digital... or with movies just slapped into the Red Box at your local grocery store. Regardless, the Last Blockbuster in Bend is a tribute to anyone who lived in the 90s, especially with their museum section and classic memorabilia everywhere. Thanks to the owner Sandi for allowing us to film in the store! And, sorry that our audio isn't the best, the store is very active.

Cinemassacre reviews Dennis The Menace on Rental Reviews. In Dennis The Menace (1993) mischievous Dennis Mitchell (Mason Gamble) makes the life of neighbor George Wilson (Walter Matthau) miserable with his overactive energy and inadvertent troublemaking. Because his parents must leave town for work and can't find a baby sitter for Dennis, they ask George and his wife, Martha (Joan Plowright), to take care of him. But when burglar Switchblade Sam (Christopher Lloyd) breaks in to steal George's gold coin collection, he takes Dennis as a hostage, and crusty George must save the boy.
